# Project Summary

A simple chatbot designed to respond to messages from users. Responses will be selected randomly from among a set list of pre-programmed responses.

# Project Users

This bot is for anyone who has an internet connection and desires to have a useless conversation with a faceless bot on the Web.

# MVP

* Users can type messages into a message box

* Users can click send to feed their message to the bot

* The bot should be able to respond when a message is sent, appearing as a separate user

* Users should be able to view responses to their messages in a simple GUI
